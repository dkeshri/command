if you got the error like this 

After recently installing a system update droidcam will no longer open and fails with the message: Device not found (/dev/video[0-9]). Did you install it?

do the following things

$ sudo apt install v4l2loopback-utils v4l2loopback-dkms cmake nasm yasm pkg-config libgtk2.0-dev
$ sudo modprobe v4l2loopback
$ v4l2-ctl --list-devices     # check if you have dummy video devices
Dummy video device (0x0000) (platform:v4l2loopback-000):
